from boruta import BorutaPy using this we build our model and got most max accuracy.
In this model Developed a predictive model to assess credit risk and predict the likelihood of loan default.
Utilized machine-learning techniques to analysis historical lending data and identify factors contributing to credit risk.
Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting credit risk, assisting in informed decision-making for loan approval.
This project has potential to contribute to the improvement of risk management strategies and the reduction of loan default rates
